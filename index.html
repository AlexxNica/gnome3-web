  <div class="grid_16">
    <p>For GNOME 3, the GNOME Project has started from scratch and created a completely new, modern desktop designed for today's users and technologies. Here are some of the things that you can expect from the new GNOME:</p>

  <h2>Simply beautiful</h2>

  <p>GNOME's new desktop takes elegance to a new level. We've swept away the clutter and made a simple and easy-to-use desktop, and we've made this the most beautiful GNOME desktop ever, with a new visual theme, a refined new font and carefully crafted animations--all while preserving compatibilty.</p>

  <h2>An overview at a glance</h2>

  <p>The activities view provides an easy way to access all your windows and applications. It is also a great way to keep track of all your activities. We have provided several fast and convenient ways to access the activities view, including the activities keyboard key (often known as the Windows key) and the activities hot corner.</p>

  <div class="grid_10">
    <h2>Messaging built-in</h2>

    <p>Communication is an important part of the modern desktop, but it's a hassle when you have to switch windows to reply to a message. That's why GNOME 3 will let you continue your conversations without changing focus. The ability to enter a reply straight into messaging notifications makes instant messaging quick and effortless.</p>

    <h2>Distraction-free computing</h2>

    <p>GNOME 3 is designed to reduce distraction and interruption and to put you in control. Our new notifications system subtly presents messages and will save them until you are ready for them, and the GNOME 3 panel has been styled so that it is part of the background, not the foreground. These changes allow you to focus on your creative tasks.</p>

  <div class="grid_6"><a href="img/search-big.png" rel="fancybox"><img class="screenshot" src="img/search.png"/></a></div>

  <div class="grid_10">
    <h2>Everything at your fingertips</h2>

    <p>With the new GNOME desktop, everything can be quickly accessed from the keyboard. Press the activities key and search: it's as simple as that. You'll love this feature if you're a user who likes things to happen fast.</p>

    <h2>Redesigned system settings</h2>

    <p>Our system settings have been completely redesigned for GNOME 3, making them easier to use than ever before. There are some great new features in our system settings too, such as the ability to use Flickr images as desktop backgrounds. </p>

  <div class="grid_16 muchmore">
    <h2>And much, much more</h2>

    <p>GNOME 3 is crammed full of new features. Here are some of the other things that you can look forward to from GNOME 3:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Window tiling to make using several windows simple and easy</li>
      <li>An improved file manager</li>
      <li>Dark application themes for when you want to focus on pictures and videos</li>
      <li>Redesigned workspaces so you can easily organise your windows</li>
      <li>Major changes under the hood to give you a faster, smoother experience</li>
      <li>A satisfying experience, whatever kind of computer you use: GNOME 3 will feel right at home on netbooks as well as larger machines</li>
