    <h2>How do I get GNOME 3?</h2>

    <p>GNOME 3 is scheduled for release on 6th April 2011 and will be available via popular distributions after that time. See the <a href="tryit.html">Try It</a> page for more details and for links to a live demos.</p>

    <h2>What is the GNOME Project, anyway?</h2>

    <p>The GNOME Project is an international community which comes together to make great software. GNOME software is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>: all our work is free to use, modify and redistribute. Everyone is welcome to participate in its development. See <a href="http://www.gnome.org/about/">the GNOME About page</a> for more information.</p>

    <h2>Will my computer be able to run GNOME 3?</h2>

    <p>Computers purchased in the last 4 or 5 years should be more than capable of running GNOME 3. The GNOME 3 desktop does require hardware accelerated graphics in order to provide a cutting-edge experience however, and the complete GNOME 3 experience will only be available on computers capable of this. Do not worry though: GNOME 3 will come complete with a fallback interface which will provide an excellent experience in the absence of hardware acceleration, and which incorporates many of the improvements that can be found in GNOME 3. Furthermore, the GNOME project and its partners are working hard to ensure that the complete GNOME 3 experience is available to as many people as possible, and aim to ensure that users who are initially unable to have this experience will be able to in the future.</p>

    <h2>Will I be able to use my favourite GNOME apps in GNOME 3?</h2>

    <p>Yes! Existing GNOME applications will work just fine in GNOME 3. GNOME 3 does provide facilities to make applications even better though, so look out for new and improved GNOME 3 versions of those trusty apps you've learnt to love.</p>


    <h2>What will happen to the old version of GNOME?</h2>

    <p>The GNOME 2 desktop had a long life, and parts of it became difficult to maintain over that period. As a result, continued releases of the entire GNOME 2 desktop was never a practical option for the GNOME Project, and several parts of the old GNOME 2 desktop will not receive new releases after GNOME 3 is released. The traditional GNOME 2 desktop will not disappear overnight, however: releases of GNOME 2 will continue to be supported by distributions for years to come.</p>

    <h2>Why is the GNOME 3 desktop designed the way it is?</h2>

    <p>A huge amount of work has gone into the design of GNOME 3, and each of the design decisions behind it has a carefully considered rationale. If you have a specific question about one of these design decisions, try reading our <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Design/FAQ">answers to common GNOME 3 design questions</a>. Alternatively, more extensive details about the design of the GNOME 3 desktop can be found on the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Design/">GNOME 3 desktop design wiki page</a>.</p>

    <h2>What are GNOME's plans after GNOME 3 is released?</h2>

    <p>We are going to have a huge party to celebrate the release, and then we're going to get back to work improving our desktop, so that GNOME 3 will get better and better with subsequent releases. We have lots of plans for new features which will make GNOME even easier and more satisfying to use, such as document search and an exciting new desktop extensions framework.</p>

    <h2>How can I get involved or help with GNOME 3?</h2>
