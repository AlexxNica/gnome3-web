    <h2>The release</h2>

    <h3>How do I get GNOME 3?</h3>
    <p>GNOME 3 is available via popular distributions. See the <a href="tryit.html">Try It</a> page for more details and for links to live demos.</p>

    <h3>Will my computer be able to run GNOME 3?</h3>
    <p>Computers purchased in the last 4 or 5 years should be more than capable of running GNOME 3. The GNOME 3 desktop does require hardware accelerated graphics in order to provide a cutting-edge experience however, and the complete GNOME 3 experience will only be available on computers capable of this. Do not worry though: GNOME 3 comes complete with a fallback interface which will provide an excellent experience in the absence of hardware acceleration, and which incorporates many of the improvements that can be found in GNOME 3.</p>
    <p>The GNOME project and its partners are working hard to ensure that the complete GNOME 3 experience is available to as many people as possible, and aim to ensure that users who are initially unable to have this experience will be able to in the future.</p>

    <h3>Can I use my favourite GNOME apps in GNOME 3?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Existing GNOME applications will work just fine in GNOME 3. GNOME 3 does provide facilities to make applications even better though, so look out for new and improved GNOME 3 versions of those trusty apps you've learnt to love.</p>

    <h3>What will happen to the old version of GNOME?</h3>
    <p>GNOME 2 had a long life, and parts of it became difficult to maintain over that period. As a result, continued releases of the entire GNOME 2 desktop was never a practical option for the GNOME Project, and several parts of the old GNOME 2 desktop will not receive new releases after GNOME 3 is released. The traditional GNOME 2 desktop will not disappear overnight, however: releases of GNOME 2 will continue to be supported by distributions for years to come.</p>

    <h3>Why was the GNOME 3 desktop designed the way it was?</h3>
    <p>A huge amount of work has gone into the design of GNOME 3, and each of the design decisions behind it has a carefully considered rationale. If you have a specific question about one of these design decisions, try reading our <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Design/FAQ">answers to common GNOME 3 design questions</a>. Alternatively, more extensive details about the design of the GNOME 3 desktop can be found on the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Design/">GNOME 3 desktop design wiki page</a>.</p>

    <h2>The GNOME Project</h2>

    <h3>What is the GNOME Project, anyway?</h3>
    <p>The GNOME Project is an international community which comes together to make great software. GNOME software is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>: all our work is free to use, modify and redistribute. Everyone is welcome to participate in its development. See <a href="http://www.gnome.org/about/">the GNOME About page</a> for more information.</p>

    <h3>What are GNOME's plans after GNOME 3 is released?</h3>
    <p>The GNOME Project is already working hard on the next release of GNOME 3, which will be completed in September/October 2011. This next release will include general improvements to GNOME 3, as well as major new features.</p>

    <h3>How can I get involved or help with GNOME 3?</h3>
