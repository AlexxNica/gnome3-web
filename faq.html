<h2>How do I get GNOME 3?</h2>

<p>GNOME 3 is scheduled for release in April 2010 and will be available via popular Linux distributions after that time. Further details of how you can get GNOME 3 will posted on this site once it is available. If you can't wait that long, our <a href="www.gnome3.org/trytit.html">Try It</a> page contains details on how to try a development version.</p>

<h2>Will my computer be able to run GNOME 3?</h2>

<p>Computers purchased in the last 4 or 5 years should be more than capable of running GNOME 3. The GNOME 3 desktop does require hardware accelerated graphics in order to provide a cutting-edge experience however, and the complete GNOME 3 experience will only be available on computers capable of this. Do not worry though: GNOME 3 will come complete with a fallback interface which will provide an excellent experience in the absence of hardware acceleration, and which incorporates many of the improvements that can be found in GNOME 3. Furthermore, the GNOME project and its partners are working hard to ensure that the complete GNOME 3 experience is available to as many people as possible, and aim to ensure that users who are initially unable to have this experience will be able to in the future.</p>

<h2>Will I be able to use my favourite GNOME apps in GNOME 3?</h2>

<p>Yes! Existing GNOME applications will work just fine in GNOME 3. GNOME 3 does provide facilities to make applications even better though, so look out for new and improved GNOME 3 versions of those trusty apps you've learnt to love.</p>

<h2>What will happen to the old version of GNOME?</h2>

<p>The GNOME 2 desktop had an long life, and parts of it became difficult to maintain over that period. As a result, continued releases of the entire GNOME 2 desktop was never a practical option for the GNOME Project, and several parts of the old GNOME 2 desktop will not receive new releases after GNOME 3 is released. The traditional GNOME 2 desktop will not disappear overnight, however: releases of GNOME 2 will continue to be supported by Linux distributions for years to come.</p>

<h2>What is the reasoning behind the design of GNOME 3?</h2>

<p>A huge amount of work has gone into the design of GNOME 3, and each of the design decisions behind it has a carefully considered rationale. Answers to common questions about the GNOME 3 desktop design can be found on <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Design/FAQ">this page</a>. If you want to learn more, extensive details on the reasoning behind the design of GNOME 3 are located on the <a href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeShell/Design/">GNOME wiki</a>.</p>

<h2>What are GNOME's plans after GNOME 3 is released?</h2>

<p>We are going to have a huge party to celebrate the release, and then we're going to get back to work improving our desktop, so that GNOME 3 will get better and better with subsequent releases. We have lots of plans for new features which will make GNOME even easier and more satisfying to use, such as document search and an exciting new desktop extensions framework.</p>
