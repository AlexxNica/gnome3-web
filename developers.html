    <p>GNOME 3 represents a major milestone in the evolution of the GNOME developer platform. Our developer technologies have been restructured and streamlined for 3.0, making them substantially easier and more efficient to use. The software developed using the GNOME 3 platform will also be faster, richer and more flexible. Here are some of the things that developers can look forward to from the GNOME 3 platform:</p>

  <h2>Quicker and more convenient</h2>

  <p>Version 3 of the GNOME platform is faster and easier to use than ever before. It has been substantially reduced in size, resulting in a simpler set of technologies, and large parts of our platform have been redesigned in order to make them easier to use. We have also added convenient facilities for common operations, such as the GTK Application class.</p>

  <h2>Improved performance</h2>

  <p>A streamlined platform is a fast platform. The removal of legacy API and consolidation around modern graphics libraries means that the GNOME platform is able to deliver far better performance, and opens the door to further optimisation in the future. GNOME 3 also brings a completely new configuration system, called dconf, which has been designed for speed.</p>

  <div class="grid_10">
    <h2>Richer, better looking applications</h2>

    <p>GTK's size allocation algorithms have been enhanced to produce graphical interfaces which are laid out with greater efficiency and elegance. And the introduction of the new GtkCellArea, GtkSwitch and GtkComboBoxText interface widgets means that the GNOME platform can be used to create graphical interfaces which are richer and more flexible.</p>

    <h2>Ready for tomorrow</h2>

    <p>The GNOME 3 platform has been restructured so that it can be easily integrated with tomorrow's technologies. Experimental Wayland and Broadway/HTML5 support already exists and will be further developed during the 3.x release series.</p>

  <div class="grid_10 muchmore">
    <h2>And more...</h2>

    <p>Virtually every part of the GNOME platform has been improved. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Portability: the restructuring of the GNOME platform means that GNOME technologies will be more portable than ever before.</li>
      <li>Multi-touch: GNOME 3 brings the foundations for multi-touch interaction to the GNOME platform.</li>
      <li>First-class bindings: our new GObjectIntrospection technology ensures complete and up-to-date bindings for high-level programming languages (Javascript, Python, Vala are currently supported).</li>
      <li>Theming: the introduction of CSS-based theming makes defining the look of your software quick and easy.</li>
    </ul>
