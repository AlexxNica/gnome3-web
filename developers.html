    <p>GNOME 3 represents a major milestone in the evolution of GNOME's developer technologies. These have been restructured and streamlined for 3.0, making them substantially easier and more efficient to use. The software created using the developer technologies included in GNOME 3 will also be faster, richer and more flexible. Here are some of the things that developers can look forward to from GNOME 3's developer technologies:</p>

  <h2>Quicker and more convenient</h2>

  <p>GNOME 3's developer technologies are faster and easier to use than ever before. They have been substantially reduced in size, resulting in a simpler set of resources, and large parts of them have been redesigned in order to make them easier to use. We have also added convenient facilities for common operations, such as the GTK Application class.</p>

  <h2>Improved performance</h2>

  <p>Streamlined technologies are fast technologies. The removal of legacy API and consolidation around modern graphics libraries means that GNOME's development software is able to deliver far better performance, and opens the door to further optimisation in the future. GNOME 3 also brings a completely new configuration system, called dconf, which has been designed for speed.</p>

  <div class="grid_10">
    <h2>Richer, better looking applications</h2>

    <p>GTK's size allocation algorithms have been enhanced to produce graphical interfaces which are laid out with greater efficiency and elegance. The introduction of the new GtkCellArea, GtkSwitch and GtkComboBoxText interface widgets means that GNOME's developer technologies can be used to create graphical interfaces which are richer and more flexible.</p>

    <h2>Ready for tomorrow</h2>

    <p>GNOME's developer technologies have been restructured so that they can be easily integrated with tomorrow's technologies. Experimental Wayland and Broadway/HTML5 support already exists for Gtk and will be further developed during the 3.x release series.</p>

  <div class="grid_10 muchmore">
    <h2>And more...</h2>

    <p>Virtually every part of GNOME's developer technologies has been improved for GNOME 3. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Portability: the restructuring of our developer technologies means that software produced with them will be more portable than ever before.</li>
      <li>Multi-touch: GNOME 3 brings the foundations for multi-touch interaction to key GNOME developer technologies.</li>
      <li>First-class bindings: our new GObjectIntrospection technology ensures complete and up-to-date bindings for high-level programming languages (Javascript, Python, Vala are currently supported).</li>
      <li>Theming: the introduction of CSS-based theming makes defining the look of your software quick and easy.</li>
    </ul>
